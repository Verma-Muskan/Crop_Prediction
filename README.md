# Crop_Prediction
This project aims to develop a crop prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers with informed recommendations

## Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop based on historical data and environmental parameters.
- Provides information on required fertilizers, seeds, and market prices for the recommended crop.
- Estimates the potential yield in quintal per acre for the recommended crop.
- User-friendly web application for easy input of local parameters and accessing recommendations.
- Integration of the model with real-time weather data for accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The crop prediction model utilizes the "Crop Recommendation Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on various crops, including their nutrient requirements, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters. The dataset has been preprocessed and prepared for training the machine learning model.

## Technology Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Flask (for web application)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)

## Usage
1. Enter the required parameters such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and other relevant information.
2. Click on the "Predict" button to receive the recommended crop along with additional details such as required fertilizers, seeds, market prices, and potential yield.
